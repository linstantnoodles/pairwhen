DST scenario

Lets say it's Oct 2020, we are 1 hour before clocks are put back (double occurrence ambiguity)

PAST

1. I schedule a meeting for tomorrow for 8AM.
2. Guests accept the meeting for 8AM (their time)
3. Tomorrow, eastern clocks are put back but I will _still_ be meeting at 8AM! (I just get to sleep an extra hour)


DURING-WINDOW

1. I schedule a meeting _during DST_ (unlikely)

Uh o

POST-WINDOW
